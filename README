NomNom
===========

NomNom is an application for downloading videos from Youtube and other similar
video websites that require Adobe Flash to view the video content. Video
streaming or downloading can be started simply by dropping an URL onto the
application window.

NomNom relies on a number of different other programs: quvi(1) to parse the
video links, curl(1) to download the videos, and a media streaming capable
player software, such as vlc(1), to stream the media. NomNom is written in
C++ to use the Qt framework.

The name of the application refers to the sound effect that is made when
eating something tasty or nutritious.

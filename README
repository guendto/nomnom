NomNom
===========

NomNom is an application for downloading media from Youtube and other similar
media websites that require flash to view the media content. Media streaming
or downloading can be started simply by dropping an URL onto the application
window.

NomNom relies on a number of different other programs: quvi(1) to parse the
media links, curl(1) to download the media, and a media streaming capable
player software, such as vlc(1), to stream the media. NomNom is written in
C++ to use the Qt framework.

The name of the application refers to the sound effect that is made when
eating something tasty or nutritious.

Prerequisites
=============

* quvi (0.2.16.1+)  <http://quvi.googlecode.com/>
* umph (0.1.6+)     <http://umph.googlecode.com/>
* curl (7.20.0+)    <http://curl.haxx.se/>
* qt   (4.6+)       <http://qt.nokia.com/>
* media player that supports streaming (e.g. vlc, mplayer)

Note that nomnom may or may not compile with earlier versions.
The above versions are the ones that I've tested.


Installation from source
========================

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
If you are compiling nomnom from the development code from the git
repository, see "Installation from development code", instead.

  --without-manual    Do not install manual page(s)


Installation from development code
==================================

If you are compiling nomnom from the development code, run "autogen.sh",
first. This generates the configuration files that are not in the git
repository. You will need:

  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU autoconf
  * GNU automake

Once the files have been generated, follow the instructions in "Installation
from source" above.
